#Autorec : Autoencoder meets Collaborative Filtering

##Python Tensorflow Implementation

###This is a forked version of [this repository](https://github.com/gtshs2/Autorec).

This version accepts UPL size in arguments as --upl and separates test and train
data based on profile sizes. For example for UPL=10 it keeps 10 items of each
user in train data and put rest in test data. I also changed test method so now the model is capable of calculating
NDCG instead of RMSE.
